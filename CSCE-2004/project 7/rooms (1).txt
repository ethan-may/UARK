You have entered the prized wine cellar. As you wander around, you come to
find all the bottles are still perfectly in place, but some are empty,
and some are still full. You hear someone coming and duck behind a table to hide.

You just waltzed into the front doors of an abandoned castle. When you
spark up a match, you realize it's not just SOME mansion. In fact,
it's the oldest mansion the land has had in centuries. As you
take a look around, you decide it might be fun to explore the rest of the castle.

You have entered a huge attic filled with empty boxes
and clutter. Looking at the side of one box, you see 'Troll Food'.
As you take a closer look, you see something shiny hidden behind
all the boxes... A Treasure Chest! Quick, take your earnings and
leave while you still can!

You have entered a ginormous bathroom with a shower bigger than
your entire bathroom back home. As you peak inside the shower,
you see it's become a bunny sanctuary now. It's time to go.
